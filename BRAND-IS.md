## 3. Visual Identity

### 3.1 Design Philosophy

Inspired by the LiFI 25 festival identity: **one stripped-back visual system, with individuality expressed through color, behavior, and context.** Each news category gets its own character — same visual DNA, different expression.

### 3.2 Color System

| Token              | Hex       | Usage                                      |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `--ink`            | `#0d0d0d` | Primary text, high-contrast elements        |
| `--paper`          | `#ffffff` | Backgrounds, negative space                 |
| `--fog`            | `#f7f7f7` | Surface cards, subtle backgrounds           |
| `--signal`         | `#015ee8` | Accent, links, interactive elements         |
| `--mute`           | `#8e8e8e` | Secondary text, metadata                    |
| `--border`         | `#ececec` | Dividers, card outlines                     |

**Section accent palette** (for AI-generated imagery per category):

| Section       | Color Name   | Hex       | Mood                        |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `tools`       | Electric     | `#015ee8` | Precision, building          |
| `research`    | Violet       | `#7c3aed` | Discovery, depth             |
| `business`    | Emerald      | `#059669` | Growth, momentum             |
| `policy`      | Amber        | `#d97706` | Caution, governance          |
| `concerns`    | Crimson      | `#dc2626` | Urgency, attention           |

### 3.3 Typography

| Role       | Family           | Weight | Usage                           |
|------------|------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Headlines  | Space Grotesk    | 700    | Hero titles, section headers    |
| Body       | Space Grotesk    | 400    | Article text, summaries         |
| Data/Meta  | Space Mono       | 400    | Tags, dates, IDs, captions      |

### 3.4 Graphic Motif: "Signal Forms"

The core visual motif is **Signal Forms** — abstract, geometric shapes that represent the flow of information through the AI landscape.

**The metaphor:** Each shape is a "signal" — a piece of news traveling through the network. Signals cluster (big stories), drift alone (niche research), or pulse (breaking developments).

| Element          | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nodes**        | Simple circles/dots — individual stories or data points       |
| **Pathways**     | Flowing lines or arcs — connections between ideas             |
| **Clusters**     | Grouped nodes — major themes or trending topics               |
| **Pulse rings**  | Concentric circles radiating outward — breaking/impactful news|
| **Grid/lattice** | Structured dots or lines — the underlying order we provide    |

These forms should feel: **precise, calm, slightly futuristic, but never cold.**

## 4. AI Image Generation System (Gemini Nano Banana)

### 4.1 Purpose

Every news story or section gets a paired editorial illustration generated by Gemini, creating a cohesive visual layer across the feed. Images serve as **mood anchors** — they set the emotional tone of a story before the reader reads a word.

### 4.2 Master Prompt Template

Use this base prompt structure for all image generation. Swap the `{variables}` per story.

```
BASE PROMPT:
"Minimal editorial illustration for a news publication called THE AI FEED.

Color palette: White background with {section_color} as the dominant accent color, with subtle gray (#f7f7f7) shapes for depth.
Mood: {mood} — calm, precise, slightly futuristic.
Subject hint: {subject_hint}
Composition: Clean negative space, asymmetric balance, shapes suggest {metaphor} without being literal.
No text, no faces, no photorealism, no gradients. Flat color, sharp edges, print-quality."
```

```

## 5. Layout Integration

### 5.1 Where Images Appear

| Location          | Image type       | Size          | Behavior            |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| HERO              | Hero image       | Full-width bg | Behind gradient overlay |
| FEED cards        | Card image       | Top of card   | Above title          |
| STORY PAGE        | Card image       | Top banner    | Full-width           |
| SIMPLE            | Summary banner   | Inline        | Behind/beside text   |

### 5.2 Image-Free Fallback

When images are unavailable, cards display with:
- A colored top-border (2px) using the section accent color
- The section's color as a subtle background tint at 5% opacity
- This ensures visual category differentiation without images
