  "simpleSummary": "The Pentagon's clash with Anthropic over military AI use exploded into a full government showdown today—President Trump ordered federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's products, and Defense Secretary Hegseth labeled the company a supply-chain risk. Meanwhile, tech workers from Google and OpenAI publicly backed Anthropic's stance against allowing unrestricted military access to their AI. On a brighter note, OpenAI just raised a record-breaking $110 billion (including $50 billion from Amazon), bringing ChatGPT to 900 million weekly users, and AI music generator Suno hit 2 million paid subscribers.",

President Trump's order to ban Anthropic from federal agencies and Hegseth's 'supply-chain risk' designation represent an unprecedented escalation—essentially weaponizing government procurement against a company for its ethical stance. Meanwhile, Google and OpenAI employees are mobilizing against similar demands from their own employers, suggesting this conflict will define AI governance for years.
